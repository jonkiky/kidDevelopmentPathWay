              <h3>What is Logical-Mathematical</h3>

							<p>Multiple Intelligences is a theory by Howard Gardner proposing that intelligence is not a single entity but a combination of distinct abilities. Gardner initially identified seven intelligences, including linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. He later added naturalist intelligence. This theory suggests that individuals can excel in different ways, and traditional measures like IQ may not capture the full spectrum of human abilities.</p>
