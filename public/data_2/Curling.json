It involves players sliding stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles. This sport is often referred to as \"chess on ice\" due to its emphasis on strategy and teamwork. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also known as rocks, across the ice curling sheet towards the house, a circular target marked on the ice. Each team tries to get their stones closest to the center of the target, while also employing tactics to protect their stones or remove their opponents' stones from the target area.</p>\n\n<p>What makes curling particularly appealing for young participants is its unique blend of physical activity, mental strategy, and social interaction. It encourages children to think ahead, work closely with teammates, and develop fine motor skills as they learn to deliver the stones with precision.
