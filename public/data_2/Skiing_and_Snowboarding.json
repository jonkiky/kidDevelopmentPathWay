Consider renting equipment initially, as children grow quickly and their sizes change from season to season. Helmets are a must for safety.</li>\n  <li><strong>Start with Professional Lessons:</strong> Enroll your child in lessons with a certified instructor who is experienced in teaching young children. Group lessons can be fun and social, but private lessons offer more personalized attention.

Ensure they understand how to use the lifts safely and to ski or snowboard within their ability level.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep it Short and Sweet:</strong> Young children can tire easily, so start with short sessions and gradually increase the duration as their stamina and interest grow.
