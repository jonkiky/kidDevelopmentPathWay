Play the game with them, guiding them through the thought process and strategies in a fun and supportive manner.</li>\n  <li><strong>Patience and Encouragement:</strong> Learning Go can be challenging. It's important to be patient and encourage your child, celebrating small victories and progress to keep them motivated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Remember, the goal is to make learning Go a fun and educational experience.
